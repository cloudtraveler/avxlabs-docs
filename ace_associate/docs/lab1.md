# Lab 1

## Lab Overview - What's in the lab?
Lab time: ~15 minutes

You have been tasked with building connectivity and security for an application in the cloud. It just so happens that the different tiers of the application are spread out across different VPCs and VNets in Azure and AWS.

The application components are already deployed in each of the VPCs/VNets, all you have to do is build out the connectivity. The app is only available via private IP address, which you can access using a web-based RDP server, which is available on-prem.

## Lab 1.1 - Aviatrix Controller
The **Aviatrix Controller** is deployed in a Shared Services VPC in AWS. 
### Description
Log in to the Aviatrix Controller
### Validate
1. Open your browser and navigate to [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
2. Take note of the `username` and `password` for Aviatrix Controller.
3. Click the **Open Controller** button

Alternatively, you can access the Aviatrix Controller using the information below:

**URL:** ctrl.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com  

```{note}
Replace X in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you. You can view the pod number by accessing the [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
>Username: ```student```   
>Password: ```refer to ACE Associate Lab Portal```
```

### Expected Results
Explore the Dashboard. As you can see, there are already gateways deployed in different Cloud Service Provider (CSP) environments. Do they seem connected to each other? Do you think this connection is working? Why do you think so?

## Lab 1.2 - Aviatrix CoPilot
CoPilot is the Visualization component of the Aviatrix platform, which you use for Monitoring and Troubleshooting.
### Description
Log in to CoPilot
### Validate
You can access CoPilot by logging into the Controller and clicking on the apps icon in the top-right of the page, then the CoPilot dropdown.

Alternatively, you can log in directly to CoPilot using the following details:

**URL:**  cplt.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

```{note}
Replace X in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you. You can view the pod number by accessing the [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
>
> **Username:** ```student```   
> **Password:** ```Same as Controller Password```
```

### Expected Results
You should be successfully logged into CoPilot.

Use the search bar on the left to get to the Topology Page within Copilot as shown below. 

The initial topology should look similar to the following screenshot.  Throughout the labs, refresh the CoPilot Topology to show the connectivity, and latency of the links.

## Lab 1.3 - Remote Access Server
To access the cloud environment, you have been provided a **clientless** Remote Access Server, which is running in your “Data Center”. This conveniently offers a *web-based* HTML5 based RDP experience, so there should be no need to install any client.

### Description
Log in to the Remote Access Server.

### Validate
1. Open your browser and navigate to [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
2. Take note of the `username` and `password` for Remote Access Server.
3. Click the **Open Server** button

Alternatively, you can access the Remote Access Server using the details below:

**URL:** client.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com  

```{note}
Replace X in the **URL** with the pod number assigned to you. You can view the pod number by accessing the [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
>
> **Username:** ```student```   
> **Password:** ```refer to ACE Associate Lab Portal```
```

### Expected Results
Once you log in, you will see:
- An icon labeled 'LX Terminal'. Use this for performing Pings from the Remote Access Server.
- An icon for Firefox web browser. Use this to perform other connectivity tests in Lab 2.

```{note}
If you are experiencing sluggishness with the web-based RDP experience, you can use any RDP client. The username will be `podX`, where **X** is the pod number assigned to you.
```

## Lab 1.5 - Servers
The application tiers have been pre-deployed and are available under the following FQDNs and Ports:

| App Tier  | FQDN  | TCP Port  |
|:---------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| Web       | web.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com  | 80  |
| App       | app.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com  | 8080  |
| Database  | db.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com | 443 |

### Description
Test connectivity between App tiers
### Validate
Throughout the labs, using the RDP Session, open Firefox and navigate to:

**URL:** web.pod**X**.aviatrixlab.com

You can also try to ping the different app tiers using the Terminal icon on the Desktop of the Remote Access Server:

```bash
ping web.podX.aviatrixlab.com
ping app.podX.aviatrixlab.com
ping db.podX.aviatrixlab.com
```

```{hint}
Replace **X** in the **URLs** with the pod number assigned to you. You can view the pod number by accessing the [ACE Associate Lab Portal](https://associate-portal.ace.aviatrixlab.com)
```

### Expected Results
The connectivity is not yet built, so none of the tests should work.
