# Lab 9 - THREATIQ & THREATGUARD

## 1. Objective

This lab will demonstrate how `ThreatIQ` and `ThreatGuard` work.
 
## 2. ThreatIQ Overview

Aviatrix gateways send NetFlow data to CoPilot. CoPilot uses this data in many ways. **FlowIQ** is one. **ThreatIQ** is another. ThreatIQ alerts you on Malicious IPs with bad reputations. These IPs are reported in the ThreatIQ database that CoPilot maintains.

```{important}
ThreatIQ and ThreatGuard work as soon as a **_Public Subnet Filtering_** gateway is deployed. This is because the PSF gateway intercepts Ingress traffic.
```

## 3. Topology

In this lab, we will deploy a `“PSF"` gateway in AWS US-EAST-1 region.

## 4. PSF
### 4.1 Deploy the PSF

Go to **CoPilot > Cloud Fabric > Gateways > Specialty Gateways**, then click on the `“+Gateway"` button and then choose the **Public Subnet Filtering Gateway**.

```{figure} images/lab9-psf.png
---
align: center
---
PSF
```

Insert the following parameters:
- **Name**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>aws-us-east1-psf</span>
- **Account**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>aws-account</span>
- **Region**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>us-east-1 (N. Virginia)</span>
- **VPC**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>aws-us-east1-spoke1</span>
- **Instance Size**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>t2.medium</span>
- **Attach to Unused Subnet**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>us-east-1a</span>
- **Instance Size**: <span style='color:#33ECFF'>aws-us-east1-spoke1-rtb-public-a</span>

Do not forget to click on **Save**.

```{warning}
Wait for about **8** minutes for the completion of the PSF deployment
```

```

### 4.2 Verification

- Click on the **PSF** gateway, select the **VPC/VNet Route Tables** and then inspect the **_aviatrix-Aviatrix-Filter-Gateway_** Route Table

```{figure} images/lab9-psfclick.png
---
align: center
---
PSF deployed
```

```{figure} images/lab9-routetablepsf.png
---
align: center
---
PSF rtb
```

```{note}
The subnet with the PSF gateway is a Public Subnet with 0/0 pointing to IGW. No workload instances should be deployed in this subnet.
```

- Verify one more routing table that we selected while deploying the PSF Gateway: **_aws-us-east1-spoke1-public-a_**. You can notice that the default route is pointing towards the PSF Gateway (we are verifying this rtb because the test instance’s subnet points to this rtb).

## 5. Enable ThreatIQ and ThreatGuard

Navigate to **CoPilot > Security > ThreatIQ > Configuration**

Click on **Send Alert**:

```{figure} images/lab9-sendalert.png
---
align: center
---
Enable ThreatIQ
```

Then click on **Notification Settings**.

```{figure} images/lab9-notification.png
---
align: center
---
Notification Settings
```

Now click on the `"+ Email Address"` button.

```{figure} images/lab9-email.png
---
align: center
---
Email
```

Choose an **alias**, insert your **personal email** and then click on **Save**:

```{figure} images/lab9-email2.png
---
align: center
---
Alias and Personal Email
```

Navigate back to **CoPilot > Security > ThreatIQ > Configuration**

Click again on **Send Alert**:

```{figure} images/lab9-sendalert2.png
---
align: center
---
Send Alert Settings
```

Click on **Add Recipients**.

```{figure} images/lab9-addrecipient.png
---
align: center
---
Add Recipient(s)
```

Select your email address from the pulldown menu and then click on **Confirm**.

```{figure} images/lab9-addjoe.png
---
align: center
---
Add your email
```

From this point onwards, if you enter a valid email address, you will receive email notifications about **ThreatIQ** alerts.

Before enabling the blocking, on the far right side, ensure that the **ThreatGuard firewall rules order** is set to `Prepend`.

```{figure} images/lab9-advanced.png
---
align: center
---
Prepend
```

Enable Block Threats (i.e. `ThreatGuard`):

```{figure} images/lab9-threatguard.png
---
align: center
---
ThreatGuard
```

By default, <ins>**all** VPCs are enabled for ThreatGuard</ins>, therefore click on **Save** to continue.


```{figure} images/lab9-vpc.png
---
align: center
---
Select VPC
```

Then, click **CONFIRM**.

```{figure} images/lab9-confirm.png
---
align: center

Confirm
```

## 5. Verification

Wait for the instructor to provide a malicious IP. Let's call it `<malicious-IP>`. 

```{important}
<ins>Note down this IP address!</ins>
```

SSH to the EC2 instance **_aws-us-east1-spoke1-test1_**

- Now test `ThreatGuard` by first issuing this command (make sure to enter **HTTPS**):

```bash
curl https://<malicious-IP>
```

```{figure} images/lab9-instancetest.png
---
align: center
---
Curl towards the malicious IP
```

Navigate back to **CoPilot > Security > ThreatIQ > Overview**

```{note}
**Wait for some minutes**, before proceeding with the next action. Furthermore, set the **Time Period** to `"Custom"` and then set the end time a bit farther than your current time:
```

```{figure} images/lab9-custom.png
---
align: center
---
Overview
```

You should see the IP in the table at the bottom. You can filter based on the destination IP address (insert the malicious IP address):

```{figure} images/lab9-threat.png
---
align: center
---
Threats
```

```{figure} images/lab9-threat2.png
---
align: center
---
Filter
```

Afterwards, click on VIEW under the column Details.

```{note}
The IP we selected might not be deemed a threat when you read this.
```

```{figure} images/lab9-view.png
---
align: center
---
View
```

```{figure} images/lab9-view2.png
---
align: center
---
Threat details
```

Then select **Threat Summary** and pinpoint the metadata "tag" to determine how ThreatIQ has classified this IP.

```{figure} images/lab9-tor.png
---
align: center
---
"tag"
```

### 5.1. Example of ThreatGuard in action

Navigate to  **CoPilot > Security > ThreatIQ > Configuration**

```{note}
The CoPilot UI frequently changes, and what you see below may differ from your experience. 
```

- Click on **VIEW** under the column View Rules:

```{figure} images/lab9-viewrules.png
---
align: center
---
Configuration VIEW
```

Filter based on the malicious IP (both on **source** address and **destination** address): you will find out that ThreatGuard applied the enforcement `"force-drop"` in both directions.

```{figure} images/lab9-force.png
---
align: center
---
Filter for source
```

```{figure} images/lab9-force2.png
---
align: center
---
Filter for destination
```

Now try issuing the same curl command once again.

```{figure} images/lab9-failed.png
---
align: center
---
Curl fails
```

ThreatGuard has successfully blocked the malicious IP!

```{warning}
Before ending this lab, remove your email from the notification list!
```

Navigate to **CoPilot > Monitor > Notifications > Alerts Configuration**

Click on the pencil icon for editing the configured alert named `"ThreatIQ Alert"`:

```{figure} images/lab9-notification2.png
---
align: center
---
Edit ThreatIQ Alert
```

- Remove the recipient that is identified based on the alias that you chose before, then click on **Save**.

ThreatIQ will immediately stop sending the alerts to your personal email:

```{figure} images/lab9-joe.png
---
align: center
---
Stop alerts
```

After this lab, this is how the overall topology would look like:
