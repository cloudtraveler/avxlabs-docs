# Welcome to Aviatrix IaC FlightSchool!  

This Lab Guide will guide you through the different parts of Aviatrix IaC FlightSchool.

During this hands on deep dive session, you will gain knowledge and experience in these areas:

* Experience how easy it is to build and orchestrate networking in the cloud
* Segment, secure and automate routing within your cloud environment
* Import existing infrastructure and configure it with code
* Easily insert NGFW into your east-west data path
* All with the Aviatrix Terraform provider resources and modules

**Note:** In case you’re having trouble writing the Terraform code required in an exercise, you can use the code in the spoiler code blocks. In the document they are hard to read to not spoil the answer, but you can easily copy them to your editor.
