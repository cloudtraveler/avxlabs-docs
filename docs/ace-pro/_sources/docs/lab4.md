# Lab 4 - RBAC

## 1. Objective

Implement **Role-Based Access Control** using Local Authentication both on the **Controller** and on the **CoPilot**.

You will perform tasks to address the following scenario:

- For the **Controller**: create an Operator that has RW access to **Dashboard**, **Useful Tools** and **Troubleshoot** sections for all cloud accounts.
- For the **CoPilot**: create an Operator that has RW access to **Dashboard**, **Topology**, **Monitor** and **Troubleshoot** sections for all cloud accounts.

```{note}
Notice that the account you are provided in the labs is a local user called **student** that is a member of the Permission Group <ins>"admin"</ins>.
```

## 2. Configuration: RBAC for the Controller

### 2.1. Create a Permission Group

Navigate to **CoPilot > Administration > User Access > Permission Group**

Click on `“+Permission Group”`.

```

```{attention}
You will immediately notice that the RBAC feature on the CoPilot is capable to limit to each persona the visibility of the platform, showing only those sections that have been permitted.

The user copilot-op can only interact with the Cloud Fabric section (but only with the sub-section Topology, whereby, this user is not authorized to deploy gateways), the Monitor section and the Troubleshoot section.

The other sections are not more visible.
