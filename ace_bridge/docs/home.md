# Welcome to ACE Operations "Let's Troubleshoot Together" Session

The objective behind this section is to collaborate together on a pre-built scenario to put in practice some of the troubleshooting techniques and tools you have learned and benefit from the real power of the Aviatrix platform.

## 1 - Initial Scenario
The lab topology can be found below:

### 1.1. - Notes
A few notes on the scenario are here:

* This is an ingress scenario i.e. we have a **Wordpress** application that we want to publish to the world.
* The application consists of **3** components Proxy VM, Web Server VM & Database VM.
* The ALB, the Proxy VM and the Web Server VM reside in *us-east-1* region (N. Virginia).
* The Database VM resides in *us-east-2* region (Ohio).
* The setup exists in AWS but the same logic and methodology can be followed in other CSPs.
* Public Subnet Filtering Gateway (**PSF**) is used at the edge of the Ingress VPC to protect any communication from malicious IP addresses.
* External User will communicate with the Public IP address corresponding to the ALB.
* ALB will basically terminate the connection and create another connection. Recall that the ALB does SNAT.
* The target of the ALB is the NLB. Thus the traffic flow will now be from the ALB's private IP to the NLB's private IP.
* <ins>FireNet is also part of the scenario whereby you have to ensure that any traffic between any of the VPCs can be subjected to inspection!</ins>
* <ins>The Security team has confirmed that the policies on the PaloAlto FW are all correct, therefore you do not need to check its configuration!</ins>

### 1.2. - Requirements

* Time to complete is **90** minutes.
* One volunteer of the team should share the screen and navigate through the Controller and CoPilot.
* Use solely the CoPilot and the Controller. 
* The Wordpress application that is very critical to your business is <ins>broken</ins>! You are going to collaborate together to identify all the issues that are causing it to break.
* Once the 90 minutes are done, the instructor will close the breakout rooms and each team will discuss their findings & learnings for ~ 10 minutes.
* Once this is done, the instructor will highlight some of the key values that the Aviatrix Platform brings into troubleshooting and operating the setup.

### 1.3. - Wordpress is OK

If you succeed in fixing all the problems, this how the Wordpress app page would look like.
